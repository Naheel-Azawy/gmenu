* GMenu
Yet another dmenu-like utility

** Why?
I used to be that person who refuses to use anything but the original dmenu, with bunch of patches of course.
[[https://github.com/Naheel-Azawy/dmenu][My fork of dmenu]] had lots of changes and even included icons, which I haven't seen anyone attempting to implement.
But then, I had to face it. It's just impractical to write GUI with Xlib alone.
Another reason is that I wanted something that works with touch screens. GTK handles that by default.

GTK is used here because I don't like Qt. Should it be GTK4? Maybe someday.
Vala is used because I'm in rush but I didn't want it to be too crappy
